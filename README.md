# Heirloom game team
* Welcome to our game.
* our game is named "Heirloom", but that is something we could change later on.
* This game could be a platforming game with story themes changing the gameplay.
* The game could also have RPG-like combat that changes based on who your character is, and could also be different for everyone, as to not make gameplay stale.
# TEAM MEMBERS:
* Gold B; Story, artist
* Angus K; Story, coding, testing
* Aayush S; Story, coding

This could possibly be a game over screen, we think it may fit with the game's theme
