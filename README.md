# Heirloom game team
* Welcome to our game.
* our game is named "Heirloom", but that is something we could change later on.
* This game could be a platforming game with story themes changing the gameplay.
* The game could also have RPG-like combat that changes based on who your character is, and could also be different for everyone, as to not make gameplay stale.
# TEAM MEMBERS:
* Gold B; Story, artist
* Angus K; Story, coding, testing
* Aayush S; Story, coding

This could possibly be a game over screen, we think it may fit with the game's theme

OPENING SEQUENCE STORY: 
You are the main character, and you have magical abilities, but only if you are in possession of your family heirloom that has been passed down through generations. These magical abilities have made an evil being extremely jealous for as long as it has been alive, so one night, when you decide to go away from your home to visit family, you feel something missing... You think "it couldn't be anything important, right?" But without knowing, that family heirloom you had that allowed you to use magic abilities was stolen from your home. "How could I let this happen? Why didn't I just take it with me!" You think to yourself, and at that moment, you find out who could have stolen the heirloom. The long lost enemy of the family, who wanted that power so desperately had now taken control of it! Now, you must go on a quest to his lair to find your heirloom, fight and find friends, get through time magic, and maybe get your own magic abilities without needing the heirloom.
