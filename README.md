# Heirloom game team
* Welcome to our page for our game we are working on.
* We believe our game should be named "Heirloom", but that is something we could change later on.
* This game could possible be a platforming game with story themes changing the gameplay.
* The game could also have RPG-like combat that changes based on who your character is, and could also be different for everyone, as to not make gameplay stale.
# TEAM MEMBERS:
* Gold B; Story, artist
* Angus K; Story, coding, testing
* Aayush S; Story, coding

This could possibly be a game over screen, we think it may fit with the game's theme

This could possibly be the start screen of our game, or the background of it at the very least
